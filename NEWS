1.1.0: Automatically pre-turns-off the byte-compiler, by importing the new 'nobcom' package

1.1.4: Improvements to 'offarray.table' conversion (auto trim)

1.2.0: Change to subassignment, so that byte-compiler no longer has to be turned off. Also, new better autoloop. 

2.0.10 Removed "turn-off-bc.r" demo. Should now be mostly compatible with 'RTMB', via the new 'offartmb' package and use of 'reclasso', 'REPORTO'. Comparison ops now keep offarrayness; single-arg 'whichoff' now works as expected. NOOFF/nooff syntax cleaned up. Many things sanitized & generally cleaned up. Cleanliness all round.

2.0.68 Bugfix on dimseq( <>, which)
 
2.0.70 Bugfix for offarray.table() that sometimes gave empty but non-NULL names(dimnames), leading to (at least) printing woes
